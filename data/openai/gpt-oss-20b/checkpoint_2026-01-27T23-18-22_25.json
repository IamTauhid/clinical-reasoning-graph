      "contexts": [
        "The robust relationship between socioeconomic factors and health suggests that social and economic policies might substantially affect health, while other evidence suggests that medical care, the main focus of current health policy, may not be the primary determinant of population health. Income support policies are one promising avenue to improve population health. This study examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability.",
        "This study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older.",
        "Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, these results were robust for married individuals."

Blood samples were collected 24 h before (T0), during surgery (T1), at the end of anaesthesia (T2), and 12 (T3) and 24 h after surgery (T4), and assayed for interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1 alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The Mann-Whitney U-, Student's t- and Friedman tests were used to compare continuous variables, and the Pearson chi-square and Fisher test for categorical variables, with a two-sided P<0.05 considered to indicate significance.",

Baseline levels (T0) of IL-1, IL-6, CRP and lactate were comparable in both arms. IL-6, CRP and lactates levels increased during both kinds of surgery. The mean IL-6 and CPR values were higher for RRP at T1 (P = 0.01 and 0.001), T2 (P = 0.001 and<0.001), T3 (P = 0.002 and<0.001) and T4 (P<0.001 and 0.02), respectively. Lactate was higher for RRP at T2 (P = 0.001), T3 (P = 0.001) and T4 (P = 0.004), although remaining within the normal ranges. IL-1 alpha did not change at the different sample times."

Normal small bowel mucosa was found in four of eight on gluten-containing diet and in four of four with gluten transgression. Two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten.

Mean Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements. Female gender was independently associated with a 43% and 23% lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection, respectively.

Additionally, specialty drugs require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with these agents can be daunting.

In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care).",
        "Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.",

The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.",

A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up.

The following were recorded: the weight of resected tissue, the duration of the resection procedure, the volume of irrigation used, the amount of irrigation absorbed and the hemoglobin and sodium levels in the serum during the procedure.",
        "There were no differences between the groups in the amount of irrigation fluid used per operation, the amount of irrigation fluid absorbed or hematocrit and hemoglobin variation during the procedure. The weight of resected tissue per minute was approximately four times higher in group III than in groups I and II. The mean absorbed irrigation fluid was similar between the groups, with no statistical difference between them (p=0.24). Four patients (6%) presented with TUR syndrome, without a significant difference between the groups."
