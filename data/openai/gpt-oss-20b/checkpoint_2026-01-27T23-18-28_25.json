The second cohort was those referred between December 2006 and May 2009 with whom the diagnosis of ARM had not been made within 24 h of birth.",
        "Nineteen infants were referred with delayed diagnosis of an ARM over the 7.5 years of the study. Of 44 patients referred to our institution between December 2006 and May 2009, diagnosis of an ARM was delayed more than 24 h in 14 (32%). There was no difference in gender, birth weight, prematurity, type of malformation or presence of associated anomalies between those with timely and delayed diagnosis of their ARM. A significantly greater proportion of those with a delayed diagnosis presented with obstructive symptoms (86% vs. 27%, P<0.001), including abdominal distension (57%) and delayed passage of meconium or stool (29%). Despite undergoing neonatal examination, the diagnosis of ARM was missed in 12 patients overall."

        "The response rate was 77% (328/424). Forty-one percent of men versus 27% of women planned to have children during residency (P = .01). The instrument measured four career threats-extended training, loss of fellowship positions, pregnancy complications, and interference with career plans-on a five-point Likert scale. The scale had a Cronbach alpha of 0.84 and an eigenvalue of 2.2. Compared with men, women had higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]).

Only 6 residents (5.50%) practiced physical activity according to international guidelines (more than three times a week for more than 30 minutes each time). Most residents (n = 76 ; 69.73%) used to skip one or two meals especially breakfast and as a consequence 30 male (44.11%) and 4 female (9.75%) students were overweight, with a statistical difference between the two sexes (Fisher test, p-value = 0.001). Twenty-eight residents (25.69%) were smokers with a male predominance. Fourteen residents of both genders (12.84%) drank alcohol regularly (>3 times a week) and 71 (65.14%) had a drink occasionally (once a month or less). Only 25 residents (23%) of the cohort had a complete and up-to-date immunization status. The immunization gap was basically against measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (dT Polio). Ninety-nine residents (90.83%) had full immunization against hepatitis B with an adequate response in 78 residents (71.56%)."

This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients.",
        "The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages.",
        "Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation promoted macrophage proliferation."

The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period.",
        "The average age of the patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction. All patients underwent neuromonitoring of their upper extremities, and some underwent lower extremity monitoring as well. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss. One patient had transient lower extremity weakness, which returned to baseline within 1 month of surgery."

The largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%."

Moreover, both pT3a and pT3b stages included patients with heterogeneous outcomes. In multivariable analysis, the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of CSS (p for trend<0.0001). However, the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role. The major limitations of the study are retrospective design, lack of central pathologic review, and the small number of patients included in some substages."
