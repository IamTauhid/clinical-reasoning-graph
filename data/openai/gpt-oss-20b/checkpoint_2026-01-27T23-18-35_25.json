        "We analyzed groups of 167 and 140 patients who were diagnosed with lymph node metastasis in the matched primary surgery group and NACT group, respectively, and no significant difference was observed (p = 0.081). The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group (18.4% vs. 38.6%, P<0.001). The metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. Clinical response, deep stromal, parametrial and lymph vascular invasions were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in the NACT group. Furthermore, deep stromal invasion and lymph vascular invasion, but not the response to NACT, were independently associated with upper LNM. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to NACT, tumor histology and a positive vaginal margin were independent prognostic factors affecting DFS or OS rates in node-positive patients treated with NACT plus radical surgery."

        "Pregnancy induces adaptations in maternal metabolism to meet the increased need for nutrients by the placenta and fetus. Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.",
        "Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.",
        "Plasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.05) expression were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart.

Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates.",
        "A total of 236 patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA<8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 patients with ETA>24 hours; patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative complications were significantly older, and had higher neutrophil count, less use of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate analysis, age ≥55 years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-8.68]; for postoperative complications, age ≥55 years (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.84-3.25), perforated appendicitis (OR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.28-7.85), and open appendectomy (OR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.36-7.58) were associated.

This study explored income-related differences in active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics including air pollution, climate and levels of green space, in urban areas across England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely to choose active transport as a means of travel.",

        "AG showed a trend toward a more prominent decrease in IBS-SSS. The responder rate at week 16 was higher for the AG group. No difference was detected in QoL between AG and placebo groups. A total of 25 patients (18 in AG group and 7 in placebo group, p = 0.016) withdrew from the study. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were more often reported as reason for withdrawal in AG group."

Those with an average home blood pressure ≥ 135 mmHg and/or ≥ 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients.",

The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects.",
        "Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance.",
