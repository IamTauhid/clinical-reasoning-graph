        "We analyzed groups of 167 and 140 patients who were diagnosed with lymph node metastasis in the matched primary surgery group and NACT group, respectively, and no significant difference was observed (p = 0.081). The incidence of lymph node metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to the non-responsive group (18.4% vs. 38.6%, P<0.001). The metastatic rates for every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. Clinical response, deep stromal, parametrial and lymph vascular invasions were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis in the NACT group. Furthermore, deep stromal invasion and lymph vascular invasion, but not the response to NACT, were independently associated with upper LNM. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to NACT, tumor histology and a positive vaginal margin were independent prognostic factors affecting DFS or OS rates in node-positive patients treated with NACT plus radical surgery."

        "Pregnancy induces adaptations in maternal metabolism to meet the increased need for nutrients by the placenta and fetus. Creatine is an important intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse.",
        "Plasma creatine concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis.",
        "Plasma creatine and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P<0.001, P<0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P<0.01), kidney (P<0.01), liver (P<0.01) and heart (P<0.05) mass at term. CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P<0.05) and skeletal muscle (P<0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart (P<0.05) and kidney (P<0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P<0.01) and protein (P<0.05) expression were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart.

Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates.",
        "A total of 236 patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA<8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 patients with ETA>24 hours; patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative complications were significantly older, and had higher neutrophil count, less use of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate analysis, age ≥55 years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-8.68]; for postoperative complications, age ≥55 years (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.84-3.25), perforated appendicitis (OR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.28-7.85), and open appendectomy (OR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.36-7.58) were associated.

This study explored income-related differences in active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics including air pollution, climate and levels of green space, in urban areas across England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely to choose active transport as a means of travel.",

The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects.",
        "Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance.",

        "We retrospectively reviewed the records of 31 children (20 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.6 years, range 1.1-17.9 years) with SCD and acute bone pain who underwent MR imaging including unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated images from 2005 to 2010. Complete clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct (high bone marrow signal intensity).",
        "Based on the clinical standard, 5 children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis). The bone marrow signal intensity on T1-W fat-saturated imaging was not significant for the differentiation between bone infarct and osteomyelitis (P = 0.56). None of the additional evaluated imaging parameters on unenhanced MRI proved reliable in differentiating these diagnoses."

The state anxiety on the day before surgery decreased only in the intervention group (34.0 (8.4) versus 36.9 (10.7); P=0.001). The mean decrease in state score during the follow-up period was greater in the intervention group (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in the length of stay or readmission. Lower proportions of chest infection were found in the intervention group (10 (5.3) versus 1 (0.5); P=0.004). Multivariate linear regression revealed that education and score in trait anxiety scale on admission are independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety."

A sample was designated as \"review for abnormality\" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation.",
        "The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (≥AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on histologic follow-up."

No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients.

      "contexts": [
        "Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.",
        "We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.",
        "Thirty-seven patients were identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up."

This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan.",
        "We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual.",
        "The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity."

Both diseases are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and frequent isolation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), from the lower airway. Defective alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells (efferocytosis), as found in other chronic lung diseases, may also contribute to tissue damage and neutrophil persistence. Thus, in children with bronchiectasis or PBB and in control subjects, we quantified the phagocytosis of airway apoptotic cells and NTHi by alveolar macrophages and related the phagocytic capacity to clinical and airway inflammation.",

Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and expression of phagocytic scavenger receptors were assessed by flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid interleukin (IL) 1β was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

      "contexts": [
        "Esophageal varices are present in 30% to 40% of patients in compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) and in 60% to 85% of patients in decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C). It is important to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis at risk for esophageal varix development. We evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference standard.",
        "Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded. Univariate logistic regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve construction for the indices that were significant.",
        "The indices HARI, HAPI, SARI, SAPI were not helpful (p > 0.05). Mean PVV, SI, and SPI were all predictive of the presence of esophageal varices (p < 0.05) and SPI was found to be the most accurate parameter. Of the various cut-off levels of SPI evaluated, a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0, offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%). For the 28 patients with SPI<5.0, the absence of esophageal varices in 27 of them could be correctly diagnosed using only SPI without invasive screening endoscopy, with high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Of the remaining 28 patients with SPI ≥5.0, presence of esophageal varices could be similarly correctly diagnosed in 22 of them by using SPI without screening endoscopy, with high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%)."

      "contexts": [
        "There has been a significant spike in fentanyl-related deaths from illicit fentanyl supplied via the heroin trade. Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications.",
        "Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl.",
        "48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5 ng/ml, (range 0.5 ng/ml to >40 ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9 ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3 ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1 ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22 ng/ml and 20 ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected.",
        "The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2 ng/ml) in apparent non-naïve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community. The average abuser of illicit opioids may be unaware of the increasing fentanyl content of their illicit opioid purchase."
