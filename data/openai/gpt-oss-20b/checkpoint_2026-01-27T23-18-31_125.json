      "contexts": [
        "This was a study to compare the results of mitral valve (MV) repair and MV replacement for the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in advanced dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy (DCM).",
        "One-hundred and thirty-two patients with severe functional MR and systolic dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 0.32 ± 0.078) underwent mitral surgery in the same time frame. The decision to replace rather than repair the MV was taken when 1 or more echocardiographic predictors of repair failure were identified at the preoperative echocardiogram. Eighty-five patients (64.4%) received MV repair and 47 patients (35.6%) received MV replacement. Preoperative characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. Only ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MV repair group (0.308 ± 0.077 vs 0.336 ± 0.076, p = 0.04).",
        "Hospital mortality was 2.3% for MV repair and 12.5% for MV replacement (p = 0.03). Actuarial survival at 2.5 years was 92 ± 3.2% for MV repair and 73 ± 7.9% for MV replacement (p = 0.02). At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (median, 1.6 years), in the MV repair group LVEF significantly increased (from 0.308 ± 0.077 to 0.382 ± 0.095, p<0.0001) and LV dimensions significantly decreased (p = 0.0001). On the other hand, in the MV replacement group LVEF did not significantly change (from 0.336 ± 0.076 to 0.31 ± 0.11, p = 0.56) and the reduction of LV dimensions was not significant. Mitral valve replacement was identified as the only predictor of hospital (odds ratio, 6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 31; p = 0.03) and overall mortality (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.9; p = 0.02)."

        "Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.",
        "An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.",
        "A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s.

        "Power of RCTs to unveil a significant association between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes was critically dependent on a complex interaction among three factors: 1) the way the RBC storage time is categorized in the trial design, 2) the temporal pattern assumed for the RBC storage lesion, and 3) the age distribution of RBCs in the inventory from which they are picked up for transfusion. For most combinations of these factors, the power of RCTs to detect a significant treatment effect was below 80%. All the four simulated RCTs had a very low power to disclose a harmful clinical effect confined to last week of the maximum 42-day shelf life of stored RBCs."

There were ethnic differences in the prevalence of HCMV infection (P<0.001) and hypertension (P<0.001). The prevalence of both increased with age (P<0.001). Before adjustment, HCMV seropositivity was significantly associated with hypertension in women (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.25-2.13, P=0.001) but not in men. After adjustment for race/ethnicity, the association between HCMV seropositivity and hypertension in women remained significant (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.20-2.02, P=0.002). Further adjustment for body mass index, diabetes status and hypercholesterolemia attenuated the association (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.10-1.90, P=0.010).

Simple slopes analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects.",

Availability of sports facilities and availability of parks were not associated with sports participation. A significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood area (OR: 1.22 (90%CI: 1.01;1.34)) was found.

However, the clinical difficulty in using this approach lies in determining which type II SCHFs can be managed successfully without a surgical intervention.",
        "We reviewed clinical and radiographic information on 259 pediatric type II SCHFs that were enrolled in a prospective registry of elbow fractures. The characteristics of the patients who were treated without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure of nonoperative management.",
        "During the course of treatment, 39 fractures were found to have unsatisfactory alignment with nonoperative management and were taken for surgery. Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful nonoperative management."

Similarly, epiphysial growth relies on endochondral ossification from the circumferential secondary physeal [corrected]. injury can result in disruption of normal ossification. The cause of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) remains elusive. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD results from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MRI appearance of the distal femoral epiphysis-particularly the secondary physis-of children with juvenile OCD and to compare these findings with the MRI findings of unaffected children.",
        "Knee MRI examinations of 30 children (age range, 8 years 8 months to 13 years 4 months) with OCD and 30 matched control patients were evaluated for skeletal maturity; location of the OCD lesion, if present; secondary physeal [corrected] continuity; overlying chondroepiphysial integrity, contour, and width; signal intensity of subchondral bone; and secondary physeal [corrected]conspicuity. Variables were compared using chi-square tests.",

All were in the middle one third, posterior one third, or middle and posterior thirds in the sagittal plane. The majority of lesions spanned the intercondylar and middle one third of the femoral condyle in the coronal plane (73%). There was a significant difference between secondary physeal [corrected] disruption in juvenile OCD condyles compared with unaffected condyles (p<0.001) and control condyles (p<0.001). Compared with unaffected and control condyles, the OCD group showed chondroepiphysial widening (p<0.001) and subchondral bone edema (p<0.001) on MRI.

All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we assessed skinfold thickness.",
        "From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54)."

The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers.",

MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis.",

The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using κ statistics.",

Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 × ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1)."

        "The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare professionals.",
        "Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals.",
        "The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and standardization of colour were raised."

      "contexts": [
        "Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.",
        "Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.",
        "From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%."

        "Schools can play an important role in the prevention of obesity, e.g. by providing an environment that stimulates healthy eating habits and by developing a food policy to provide such an environment. The effectiveness of a school food policy is affected by the content of the policy, its implementation and its support by parents, teachers and principals. The aim of this study is to detect opportunities to improve the school food policy and/or implementation at Dutch primary schools. Therefore, this study explores the school food policy and investigates schools' (teachers and principals) and parents' opinion on the school food policy.",
        "Data on the schools' perspective of the food policy was collected from principals and teachers by means of semi-structured interviews. In total 74 principals and 72 teachers from 83 Dutch primary schools were interviewed. Data on parental perceptions about the school food policy were based on a cross-sectional survey among 1,429 parents from the same schools.",
        "Most principals (87.1%) reported that their school had a written food policy; however in most cases the rules were not clearly defined. Most of the principals (87.8%) believed that their school paid sufficient attention to nutrition and health. Teachers and principals felt that parents were primarily responsible to encourage healthy eating habits among children, while 49.8% of the parents believed that it is also a responsibility of the school to foster healthy eating habits among children. Most parents reported that they appreciated the school food policy and comply with the food rules. Parents' opinion on the enforcement of the school food policy varied: 28.1% believed that the school should enforce the policy more strongly, 32.1% was satisfied, and 39.8% had no opinion on this topic."

During the follow-up period of 22.6 ± 3.8 months, additional hospitalizations numbered 1.7 ± 1.0 and more than one quarter succumbed. Admission ascitis volume corresponded to 7.1 ± 3.6 L and dry BMI to 18.3 ± 3.5 kg/m². Child Pugh index was relevant for both mortality and rehospitalization.

Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).

The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth.",
        "This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.",
        "During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5±1.4 before to 4.1±1.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12±1.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76±0.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after).

      "contexts": [
        "Patients with an enlarged prostate and suspicion of prostate cancer pose a diagnostic dilemma. The prostate cancer detection rate of systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy is between 30% and 40%. For prostates greater than 40 cc this decreases to 30% or less. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy has shown superior prostate cancer detection rates. We defined the detection rate of magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy in men with an enlarged prostate gland.",
        "We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging followed by magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy at our institution. Whole prostate volumes were calculated using magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions. Detection rates were analyzed with respect to age, prostate specific antigen and whole prostate volumes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess these parameters as independent predictors of prostate cancer detection.",
        "We analyzed 649 patients with a mean±SD age of 61.8±7.9 years and a median prostate specific antigen of 6.65 ng/ml (IQR 4.35-11.0). Mean whole prostate volume was 58.7±34.3 cc. The overall detection rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%. For prostates less than 40 cc the detection rate was 71.1% compared to 57.5%, 46.9%, 46.9% 33.3%, 36.4% and 30.4% for glands 40 to 54.9, 55 to 69.9, 70 to 84.9, 85 to 99.9, 100 to 114.9 and 115 cc or greater, respectively (p<0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression showed a significant inverse association of magnetic resonance imaging volume with prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and prostate specific antigen."

        "Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement.",
        "The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of ≥1 precursor events in the matched groups was performed.",
        "A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes."

Group 2 received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone.",
        "Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p<0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p<0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p<0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury."

        "A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second ≤16).",

All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2).

        "A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of ≤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose ≤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose ≤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine."

In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection margins in 7/32 (22%) vs. 4/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%.

      "contexts": [
        "Some pediatric patients, typically those that are very young or felt to be especially sick are temporarily admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation during their first transfusion. If a significant reaction that requires ICU management does not occur, these patients are then transferred to a regular ward where future blood products are administered. The aim of this project was to determine if heightened observation such as temporary ICU admissions for the first transfusion are warranted.",
        "From the blood bank records of a tertiary care pediatric hospital, a list of patients on whom a transfusion reaction was reported between 2007 and 2012, the type of reaction and the patient's transfusion history, were extracted. The hospital location where the transfusion occurred, and whether the patient was evaluated by the ICU team or transferred to the ICU for management of the reaction was determined from the patient's electronic medical record.",
        "There were 174 acute reactions in 150 patients. Of these 150 patients, 13 (8.7%) different patients experienced a reaction during their first transfusion; all 13 patients experienced clinically mild reactions (8 febrile non-hemolytic, 4 mild allergic, and 1 patient who simultaneously had a mild allergic and a febrile non-hemolytic), and none required ICU management. Six severe reactions (6 of 174, 3.4%) involving significant hypotension and/or hypoxia that required acute and intensive management occurred during subsequent (i.e. not the first) transfusion in six patients."
