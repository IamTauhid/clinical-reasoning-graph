Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial.",
        "A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone.",
        "The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical débridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance."

        "For the admissions we studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, especially for AMI outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to compare the patient characteristics of the ambulatory teaching centers of a consortium of seven community-based university-affiliated family practice residency programs in northeast Ohio with the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) results for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs).",
        "Ninety-eight faculty and resident physicians at the residency training site of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine collected data on all ambulatory patient visits (N = 1498) for one randomly chosen week between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992. We compared these data with patient visits reported in the 1990 NAMCS for FPs and GPs.",
        "The residency training sites saw slightly more children, women, blacks, and Medicare and Medicaid patients. The most common reason for an office visit in both populations was an undifferentiated symptom. Fifteen of the top 20 \"reason for visit\" codes were identical, as were 14 of the top 20 diagnoses. More preventive and therapeutic services were offered or performed at our residency training sites but fewer diagnostic services were performed. There were fewer consultations requested at our residency training sites but similar hospitalization rates for patients. The mean duration of visit differed by only 1 minute."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity).",

Family histories of psychiatric disorders were blindly assessed. The 24 patients with nonpsychotic BDD were compared with the 26 patients with psychotic BDD with respect to demographics, phenomenology, course of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, and treatment response.",

However, the two groups did not differ significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics."

There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the disease free survival between the two groups.

Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.",

Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients.

After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89."
