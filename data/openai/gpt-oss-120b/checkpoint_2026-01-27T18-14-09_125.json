Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF remains controversial.",
        "A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone.",
        "The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean number of surgical débridements required per patient was significantly higher in the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance."

        "For the admissions we studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, especially for AMI outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to compare the patient characteristics of the ambulatory teaching centers of a consortium of seven community-based university-affiliated family practice residency programs in northeast Ohio with the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) results for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs).",
        "Ninety-eight faculty and resident physicians at the residency training site of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine collected data on all ambulatory patient visits (N = 1498) for one randomly chosen week between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992. We compared these data with patient visits reported in the 1990 NAMCS for FPs and GPs.",
        "The residency training sites saw slightly more children, women, blacks, and Medicare and Medicaid patients. The most common reason for an office visit in both populations was an undifferentiated symptom. Fifteen of the top 20 \"reason for visit\" codes were identical, as were 14 of the top 20 diagnoses. More preventive and therapeutic services were offered or performed at our residency training sites but fewer diagnostic services were performed. There were fewer consultations requested at our residency training sites but similar hospitalization rates for patients. The mean duration of visit differed by only 1 minute."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity).",

Family histories of psychiatric disorders were blindly assessed.

However, the two groups did not differ significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics."

After retirement the ability of grade to predict mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89."

        "The charts and biopsy results of 31 patients who underwent a Kasai procedure for biliary atresia between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed. Values for preoperative albumin, bilirubin, age of patient at Kasai, and lowest postoperative bilirubin were recorded. Surgical success was defined as postoperative bilirubin that returned to normal. A pathologist blinded to the child's eventual outcome graded the pre-Kasai needle liver biopsy results according to duct proliferation, ductal plate lesion, bile in ducts, lobular inflammation, giant cells, syncitial giant cells, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, hepatocyte ballooning, bile in zone 1, 2, and 3, cholangitis, and end-stage cirrhosis. Clinical outcome was then predicted.",

Individually, the presence of syncitial giant cells, lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, and cholangitis, were each associated with failure of the portoenterostomy (P<.05).

Mean patient age was 50 years, and duration of support averaged 98 days. Although common, both preexisting infection and infection during LVAD support were not associated with increased mortality or decreased rate of successful transplantation. Thromboembolic complications were rare, occurring in only three patients (5%) despite the absence of anticoagulation. Ventricular arrhythmias were well tolerated in all patients except in cases of early perioperative right ventricular failure, with no deaths. Right ventricular failure occurred in one third of patients and was managed in a small percentage by right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support and/or inhaled nitric oxide therapy. There were no serious device malfunctions, but five graft-related hemorrhages resulted in two deaths.

In the 2-year follow-up period, however, more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline. When only teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline were considered, adults with high fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure. Market effects also were detected in demand equations; relative to adults in the nonfluoridated community, adults residing in the fluoridated community with a large dentist supply received a greater number of restorations, suggesting potential supplier-induced demand from less disease and fewer patients."

Control variables included the severity-of-illness of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night).

Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to control GVHD such as cyclosporine.",

Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide."

A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%.

        "From March 1996, 37 patients with stress urinary incontinence (>2 years) were treated using a bone anchor system. On each side the suture was attached to the pubocervical fascia and the vaginal wall via a broad 'Z'-stitch. A urodynamic investigation performed preoperatively in all patients confirmed stress incontinence and excluded detrusor instability. The outcome was assessed by either by a clinical follow-up investigation or using a standardized questionnaire, over a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 6-18).",
        "In the 37 patients, the procedure was successful in 25 (68%), with 16 (43%) of the patients completely dry and nine (24%) significantly improved. Removal of the bone anchor and suture was necessary in two patients, because of unilateral bacterial infection in one and a bilateral soft tissue granuloma in the other. One bone anchor became dislocated in a third patient. In two cases where the treatment failed, new detrusor instability was documented urodynamically. Minor complications were prolonged wound pain in 10 (26%) and transient urinary retention or residual urine in 12 patients (32%)."

      "contexts": [
        "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed by non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation) reactions, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including normoglycemic uremia. AGE research in uremia has focused on the accumulation of carbohydrate-derived adducts generated by the Maillard reaction. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that one AGE, the glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CML), could be derived not only from carbohydrates but also from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro, raising the possibility that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation might be increased in uremia.",
        "To address this hypothesis, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography to measure protein adducts formed in uremic plasma by reactions between carbonyl compounds and protein amino groups: pentosidine derived from carbohydrate-derived carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA)-lysine derived from lipid-derived carbonyls, and CML originating possibly from both sources.",
        "All three adducts were elevated in uremic plasma. Plasma CML levels were mainly (>95%) albumin bound. Their levels were not correlated with fructoselysine levels and were similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients on hemodialysis, indicating that their increase was not driven by glucose. Pentosidine and MDA-lysine were also increased in plasma to the same extent in diabetic and non-diabetic hemodialysis patients. Statistical analysis indicated that plasma levels of CML correlated weakly (P<0.05) with those of pentosidine and MDA-lysine, but that pentosidine and MDA-lysine varied independently (P>0.5)."

The cohort was followed up for 10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality.",
        "The results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular mortalities."

On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly. Length of hospitalization, oxygen use, and need for transfusion were the same in both the unsuspected and detected ACS groups. Overall physician sensitivity for predicting ACS was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with increasing levels of pediatric training."

        "Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control intraoperative hypertension.",
        "In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min.",
        "Sixteen patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when desflurane was added to restore blood pressure."

The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume.",

For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS.

Of those referred patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 62.5% had advanced forms of periodontal disease. These results were mirrored in the results of the self-reported prevalence of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus which was consistent with the published higher prevalence in periodontal patients."

The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic.",
        "Information was obtained from all patients presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain information with a standardized questionnaire.",
        "The open access patients reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the procedure (p<0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p<0.005). There was no difference between the two groups in satisfaction scores for examinations performed under conscious sedation. For flexible sigmoidoscopy without sedation, however, the GI clinic patient group were more satisfied with their procedure. The majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring physician. Furthermore, the patients in the GI clinic group who underwent colonoscopy felt significantly better at follow-up."

        "We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service.",
        "This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases.",
        "The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the hospital, due to more efficient bed usage."

Serial sections and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins were performed on all SLN that proved negative on FS. The sensitivity of FS was determined as a function of (1) tumor size and (2) volume of metastatic disease in the SLN, and the benefit of FS was defined as the avoidance of a reoperative axillary dissection.",

        "It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate.",
        "To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate.",
        "In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr.",
        "Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance."

A higher incidence of desmoids was found in patients with mutations between codons 1445 and 1580 compared with mutations at other sites, while no correlation between site of mutation and presence of duodenal adenomas was observed."

        "Patients were divided into three groups (remission, failure and relapse) depending on the late outcome of their treatment as determined at the time of analysis, i.e. 88 months (median) years after surgery. Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.",
        "Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission."

        "We studied 100 asthma patients who were divided into the following four groups: patients with obstruction who were either ICS-naive (group I) or were treated with ICSs (group II); and nonobstructed patients who were either ICS-naive (group III) or were treated with ICSs (group IV). PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed. Regression analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and factor analysis were applied for statistical evaluation.",
        "For a 5 to 20% fall in FEV(1) from the lowest point after saline solution induction, VAS score was lowest in group II, slightly higher in group I, slightly higher still in group IV, and the highest in group III. In the patients as a whole, BHR related to PD, but age, clinical score, duration of the disease, and presence of baseline airway obstruction did not. In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts related to PD negatively. Factor analysis yielded the following four factors that accounted for 70% of the variance in the data: ICS; eosinophil counts; FEV(1); and PC(20) loaded on separated factors with PD loading on the same factors as PC(20). The post hoc analysis carried out dividing the patients into ICS-treated and ICS-naive, showed that in the former group eosinophil counts and BHR proved to be factors negatively associated with PD, while in the latter group eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD."

Multiple associated abnormalities have been recognized within the external hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer, but the internal component of the pyloric mucosa has received scant attention in the literature to date. Our purpose in this study was to show that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, to discuss its possible cause, and to explore the hypothesis of a relationship between pyloric mucosal redundancy and the development of IHPS.",

      "contexts": [
        "The hypothesis of this prospective study is that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested.",
        "During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.",
        "Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, p = 0.038)."
