Participants also underwent an evaluation of their functional ambulation as measured by a 6-minute walk test. Lastly, participants were evaluated by a neurologist specially trained in movement disorders to assess neurologic status and disease severity using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr disability score.",

We also studied the best position of the probe for temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from August 2007 to May 2008.",
        "The temperature levels were the same regardless of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the conservation of human grafts."

Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages.",
        "Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively.

Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a process-oriented way of working.",

Moreover, both pT3a and pT3b stages included patients with heterogeneous outcomes. In multivariable analysis, the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of CSS (p for trend<0.0001). However, the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role.

Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P<0.01)."

        "In 913 children (AD; 132), a history of IC, MC or HI was observed in 45.1%, 19.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the odds of having a history of IC were 1.8 times higher in AD children than in non-AD children.

        "A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored.",
        "Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients."

In each case we applied published criteria for subclassification of FTLD-TDP into FTLD-TDP types 1-3. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare subjects with each of the different FTLD-TDP types to age- and gender-matched normal controls (n = 30). We also assessed different pathologic and genetic variants within, and across, the different types.",
        "Twenty-two subjects were classified as FTLD-TDP type 1, 9 as type 2, and 11 as type 3. We identified different patterns of atrophy across the types with type 1 showing frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, those with a progranulin mutation had significantly more lateral temporal lobe atrophy than those without. All type 2 subjects were diagnosed with semantic dementia. Subjects with a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD with motor neuron degeneration had a similar pattern of atrophy, regardless of whether they were type 1 or type 3."

      "contexts": [
        "A secondary analysis of one-hundred-sixty-seven patients referred for treatment of cancer-related pain was conducted. Pain intensity at admission was recorded and patients were divided in three categories of pain intensity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients were offered a treatment with opioid dose titration, according to department policy. Data regarding opioid doses and pain intensity were collected after dose titration was completed. Four levels of opioid response were considered: (a) good pain control, with minimal opioid escalation and without relevant adverse effects; (b) good pain control requiring more aggressive opioid escalation, for example doubling the doses in four days; (c) adequate pain control associated with the occurrence of adverse effects; (d) poor pain control with adverse effects.",
        "Seventy-six, forty-four, forty-one and six patients showed a response a, b, c, and d, respectively. No correlation between baseline pain intensity categories and opioid response was found. Patients with response 'b' and 'd' showed higher values of OEImg."

      "contexts": [
        "Complications associated with blood transfusions have resulted in widespread acceptance of low hematocrit levels in surgical patients. However, preoperative anemia seems to be a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes in certain surgical patients. This study investigated the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to determine if preoperative anemia in patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colectomies is an independent predictor for an adverse composite outcome (CO) consisting of myocardial infarction, stroke, progressive renal insufficiency or death within 30 days of operation, or for an increased hospital length of stay (LOS).",
        "Hematocrit levels were categorized into 4 classes: severe, moderate, mild, and no anemia. From 2005 to 2008, the NSQIP database recorded 23,348 elective open and laparoscopic colectomies that met inclusion criteria. Analyses using multivariable models, controlling for potential confounders and stratifying on propensity score, were performed.",
        "Compared with nonanemic patients, those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia were more likely to have the adverse CO with odds ratios of 1.83 (95% CI 1.05 to 3.19), 2.19 (95 % CI 1.63 to 2.94), and 1.49 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.86), respectively. Patients with a normal hematocrit had a reduced hospital LOS, compared with those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia (p<0.01). A history of cardiovascular disease did not significantly influence these findings."

During their second year, these students took four CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 cases. The authors correlated each student's average year 2 case score with the student's average case score on a senior (year 4) CPE. Contingency table analysis was carried out using performance on the year 2 CPEs and passing/failing the senior CPE. Similar analyses using each student's United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, odds ratio, and relative risk were calculated for two year 2 performance standards.",
