        "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are considered safe, but they are associated with characteristic side effects, namely cough and angioedema, usually requiring discontinuation. We perceived that referrals for these side effects have become more and more frequent; therefore, we evaluated the degree of knowledge on the safety of ACE-I in different medical categories.",
        "A questionnaire (13 questions) on side effects of ACE-I was posted to physicians.",

        "Cardiologists, allergists, and general practitioners (GPs) from the National Healthcare System.",
        "Three hundred twelve physicians were contacted, and 154 returned questionnaires that could be analyzed. Of the 154 physicians (mean age, 45 years) 48 were cardiologists, 52 were GPs, and 54 were allergists. The percentage of correct answers was low: 31.9% for cardiologists, 40% for GPs, and 33% for allergists. Thus, GPs provided a significantly higher percentage of correct answers with respect to the remaining categories (p = 0.05). The lower rate of correct answers (0 to 15.9%) concerned the time of onset of cough and the action to take. Cardiologists seemed to be less aware of the fact that angiotensin receptor blockers (sartans) can cross-react with ACE-I."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) could be increased by using an episodic memory task provocation, i.e. memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT).",

In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT."

GDM was significantly related to age and pregestational weight, while ISI(OGTT) and CP/FPG were inversely related to prepregnancy BMI or weight gain. In comparison with the index pregnancy, the subsequent pregnancy was characterized by an increase in actual and prepregnancy BMI, in 2 h area under curve (AUC) glucose and by a decrease in ISI(OGTT) (P = 0.0001). The longer the time interval between pregnancies and the higher the increment in pregestational BMI or in weight gain during the pregnancy, the greater were the ISI(OGTT) decrease and 2-h AUC glucose increase."

A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory."

Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on reports from preclinical work in the literature.",
        "Probands were 83 participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and family-based association methods.",
        "Preferential transmission of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats was not significant for hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking, using the transmission disequilibrium test. Similarly, case-control analyses found no significant associations between hypersexuality or uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats. For p<0.05, there was about 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.0 and 4.0 (in the family-based analyses) and 3.5 and 2.6 (in the case-control analyses), for allele frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively."
