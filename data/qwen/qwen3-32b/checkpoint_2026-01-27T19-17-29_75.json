After adjustment for confounding variables, we did not observe any difference between sexes in functional outcome (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.97-1.09; P=0.39), whereas male sex was related to a higher risk of mortality (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.29; P=0.00003) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio, 1.25, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.51; P=0.02)."

In the first four groups, non-ischemic colonic anastomosis was performed, whereas in the remaining four groups, ischemic colonic anastomosis was performed.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated immediately after surgery and continued for 4 days in groups 3 and 4. Groups 2 and 6 received recombinant human growth hormone, whereas groups 4 and 8 received GH and hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Relaparotomy was performed on postoperative day 4, and a perianastomotic colon segment 2 cm in length was excised for the detection of biochemical and mechanical parameters of anastomotic healing and histopathological evaluation.",

Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure.",
        "Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective radiation dose."

Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected surfaces.

The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee extension (0°) and flexion (90°) angle were recorded in three different patella positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test were used.",
        "The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position (p<0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position."

However, surgeons with such training and experience may not always be available to all patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether trauma training affects the post-operative difference in femoral version (DFV) following IMN.",
        "Between 2000 and 2009, 417 consecutive patients with diaphyseal femur fractures (AO/OTA 32A-C) were treated via IMN. Inclusion criteria for this study included complete baseline and demographic documentation as well as pre-operative films for fracture classification and post-operative CT scanogram (per institutional protocol) for version and length measurement of both the nailed and uninjured femurs. Exclusion criteria included bilateral injuries, multiple ipsilateral lower extremity fractures, previous injury, and previous deformity. Of the initial 417 subjects, 355 patients met our inclusion criteria. Other data included in our analysis were age, sex, injury mechanism, open vs. closed fracture, daytime vs. nighttime surgery, mechanism of injury, and AO and Winquist classifications. Post-operative femoral version of both lower extremities was measured on CT scanogram by an orthopaedic trauma fellowship trained surgeon. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine statistically significant risk factors for malrotation between the two cohorts.",

The mean post-operative DFV was 8.7° in these patients, compared to 10.7° in those treated by surgeons of other subspecialties. This difference was not statistically significant when accounting for other factors in a multivariate model (p>0.05). The same statistical trend was true when analyzing outcomes of only the more severe Winquist type III and IV fractures. Additionally, surgeon experience was not significantly predictive of post-operative version for either trauma or non-trauma surgeons (p>0.05 for both)."

But its prognostic value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown.AIM: To evaluate whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI).",
        "The study included 538 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: low SxS (<22) and high SxS (>22). The SxS of all patients was calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical records of our hospital.",
        "The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 25.1%, p<0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 ± 7.5% and 44.6 ± 8.8%, p<0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001)."

It offers an excellent weight loss and resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a major concern.",
        "Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered.",
        "Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a significant impact on staple line leak rate."

Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images.",

        "To examine whether government-funded, low-income vision care programs improve use of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada.",
        "Cross-sectional survey.",
        "27,375 white respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Healthy Aging 2008/2009.",
        "Government-funded, low-income vision care programs were reviewed. The amount of assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS.",
        "To receive low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years and 5.5% aged ≥65 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged ≥65 years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p<0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education."

        "It is not known whether common carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) can serve as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk among black Africans. Therefore, we examined whether CIMT differed significantly among individuals with distinct cardiovascular phenotype and correlated significantly with traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a black African population.",
        "CIMT was measured in 456 subjects with three distinct cardiovascular phenotypes - 175 consecutive Nigerian African stroke patients, 161 hypertensive patients without stroke and 120 normotensive non-smoking adults. For each pair of cardiovascular phenotypes, c-statistics were obtained for CIMT and traditional vascular risk factors (including age, gender, weight, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting plasma glucose, fasting total cholesterol). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify bivariate relationships.",
        "Bilaterally, CIMT was significantly different among the three cardiovascular phenotypes (right: p < 0.001, F = 33.8; left: p < 0.001, F = 48.6). CIMT had a higher c-statistic for differentiating stroke versus normotension (c = 0.78 right; 0.82 left, p < 0.001) and hypertension versus normotension (c = 0.65 right; 0.71 left, p < 0.001) than several traditional vascular risk factors. Bilaterally, combining all subjects, CIMT was the only factor that correlated significantly (right: 0.12 ≤ r ≤ 0.41, 0.018 ≤ p < 0.0001; left: 0.18 ≤ r ≤ 0.41, 0.005 ≤ p < 0.0001) to all the traditional cardiovascular risk factors assessed."
